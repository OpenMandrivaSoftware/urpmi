=head1 NAME

proxy.cfg - urpmi proxy configuration file format.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You can override default proxy using proxy.cfg (see the syntax below). You can
also set proxy on urpmi commands command-line using C<--proxy>.

Note that urpmi will use system global proxy settings (cf environment variable
C<http_proxy> or C<ftp_proxy>). If you don't want urpmi to use any proxy, you
can use C<http_proxy=> or C<ftp_proxy=>.

=head1 SYNTAX
The proxy.cfg file contains lines of the form

    [media:]http_proxy=[value]
    [media:]ftp_proxy=[value]
    [media:]proxy_user=[value]

where the media part is optional (in this case, the line applies to all
media). ftp_proxy and http_proxy values have the same syntax as the usual
environment variables used by many programs such as curl(1):

    [protocol://]<host>[:port]

C<proxy_user> values are simply a user name, or a user name and a password
separated by a colon (C<:>).

Alternatively, instead of C<proxy_user>, you can write:

    [protocol://]proxy_user_ask

In this case, urpmi and other tools will prompt for proxy credentials
(like with the urpmi command-line option B<--proxy-user=ask>).
