=head1 NAME

rurpmi - restricted urpmi

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 rurpmi [options] [package_names]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

rurpmi is similar to urpmi, but has a stripped-down set of features. It's
intended to be used by users with sudo rights on it, preventing them to
abuse it to compromise the system. With it, you can't install arbitrary
rpm files, the B<--keep>, B<--verify-rpm>, and B<--norebuild> options are
forced, and several dangerous options are forbidden (B<--root>,
B<--use-distrib>, B<--env>, B<--nolock>, B<--allow-nodeps>,
B<--allow-force>, B<--force>).

=head1 CAVEAT

This software is still experimental. While some operations are forbidden,
there is no guarantee it is actually secure.

=head1 OPTIONS

The options are the same than urpmi ones.
