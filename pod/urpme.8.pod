=head1 NAME

urpme - rpm deinstaller

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    urpme [options] [package_name...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

urpme allow packages to be deinstalled,
including all their dependencies. I<package_names> must have one of the forms
I<name>, I<name-version>, I<name-version-release>, or
I<name-version-release.architecture>. If you want to specify packages more
broadly, use the B<-a> option.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<--help>

Prints a help message and exit (this is the same as B<-h> or B<-?>).

=item B<-a>

If multiple packages match the given substring, deinstall them all.

=item B<-v>

Proposes a verbose mode with various messages.

=item B<--auto>

Removes packages non-interactively, without asking questions.

=item B<--test>

Test deinstallation of packages but do not modify the system.

=item B<--force>

Force invocation even if some packages do not exist.

=item B<--parallel> I<alias>

Activate distributed execution of urpmi to other machines (it is mandatory
that urpmi is installed, but it is not necessary to have media defined on
any machines). I<alias> defines which extension module is to be used by
urpmi (currently, urpmi-parallel-ka-run or urpmi-parallel-ssh are
available) and which machines should be updated. This alias is defined in
the file F</etc/urpmi/parallel.cfg> as described below.

=item B<--root> I<directory>

Use the file system tree rooted for rpm install. All operations and
scripts will run after chroot(2). The rpm database that lies in the
rooted tree will be used, but the urpmi configuration comes from the
normal system.

=item B<--use-distrib> I<directory>

Configure urpme on the fly from a distribution tree.
