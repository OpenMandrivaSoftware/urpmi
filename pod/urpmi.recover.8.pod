=head1 NAME

urpmi.recover - manages repackaging of old RPMs and rollbacks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    urpmi.recover --checkpoint
    urpmi.recover --list '1 week ago'
    urpmi.recover --rollback '1 hour ago'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<urpmi.recover> is a tool to help management of RPM rollbacks. It has
three main functions:

C<urpmi.recover --checkpoint> is used to define a point in your system
that you consider stable, and to start storing info that will enable you
to rollback installations and upgrades to this state.

C<urpmi.recover --list> is used to list chronologically all installations
and upgrades on your system.

C<urpmi.recover --rollback> is used to roll back installations and
upgrades to a previous point in the past (at most until your checkpoint.)

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --checkpoint

Define the repackaging checkpoint. From now on, using rpm and/or
urpmi/urpme to install, upgrade or remove packages, the older packages
will be stored in F</var/spool/repackage>, or whatever directory you set
the C<%_repackage_dir> rpm macro to. This way one can use them for
rollbacks.

Technically, using this option writes a file
F</etc/rpm/macros.d/urpmi.recover.macros> that overrides the rpm macros
used to set up the repackaging functionalities of rpm. You can change
C<%_repackage_dir> there if you want to. Note that you'll probably need
plenty of space to store repackaged rpms for a long timeframe.

You can also choose to turn off repackaging by setting
C<%_repackage_all_erasures> to 0 in this file. (Of course if you do so
rollbacks won't be possible anymore.)

=item --noclean

C<--checkpoint> defines a new checkpoint and removes everything in the
repackage directory. To prevent this cleaning, use the C<--noclean>
option.

=item --list <date>

Lists all installations and upgrades from now since the provided date. The
date parser is quite elaborated, so you can give a date in ISO format or
close to it (C<YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss>) or a duration (e.g. "1 day ago").

=item --list-all

Lists all installations and upgrades known to the RPM database.

=item --rollback <date>

=item --rollback <number of transactions>

Roll back the system to the given date (see C<--list> for accepted date
formats), or rolls back the given number of transactions.
