rurpme - restricted urpme

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    rurpme [options] [package_name...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

rurpme is similar to urpme, but has a stripped-down set of features. It's
intended to be used by users without root privileges but with sudo rights
on it, preventing any abuse of this tool to compromise the system.

With rurpme, the following options are forbidden: B<--root>,
B<--use-distrib>, B<--noscripts> and B<--parallel>.

=head1 CAVEAT

This software is still experimental. While some operations are forbidden,
there is no guarantee it is actually secure.

=head1 OPTIONS

The options are the same than urpme ones.
