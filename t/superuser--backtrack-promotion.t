# a.x86_64 provides b
# a.i586 does not provide b
# c conflicts with b
# d requires a
#
# user has a.x86_64, d installed
# trying to install c has to remove a, d
#
# Original problem:
# urpmi tries to promote a.i586 for d, but strict-arch does not allow it;
# backtracking finds a.i586 as well and tries it again; it still does not
# work, but urpmi already forgot the promotion and does not remove d
#
# This test doesn't work on i586 boxes, just x86_64
