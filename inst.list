# Here you can specify packages that need to be installed instead
# of being upgraded.

#
# Newer kernels (> 2.6.38) no-more use the virtual package, named
# 'kernel-*-latest', to get updated without removing the previous
# version. Instead they use the following regexp which should take
# care of keeping compatibily with both old kernels and firmware
# packages.
#
/^kernel((?!latest)(?!firmware)(?!headers).)*$/
