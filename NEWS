    (nb: not equivalent with urpmi.addmedia, since pubkey will not be imported)

  o for remote media, instead of first checking reconfig.urpmi, try MD5SUM. 
    If it fails try reconfig.urpmi

  o do not get "descriptions" on non update media since it's useless and
    potentially slow
- urpmi.addmedia:
  o --distrib: do not skip "debug_for=" media

    "Internal error: syntax error ..."
  o in some cases (iso on disk), the hdlist is not available in

- urpmf:
  o fix mirrorlist handling
  o fix fallback on hdlist when xml-info not found

  o have fatal errors on some errors that must not happen (eg: moving rpm from
    download dir to cachedir)
  o handle variables $ARCH/$RELEASE in mirrorlist
- urpmi:
  o display "%s of packages will be retrieved."
    (need perl-URPM 3.10 and synthesis built with @filesize@)

  o --test: only display "Installation is possible" when it is the case (#29837)
  o fix "using one big transaction" that occurs when using --keep

  o drop /var/lib/urpmi/names.<medium> (was used by bash-completion)
- urpmi.addmedia
  o don't fail on remaining statedir files (#36267)

Version 5.2 - 18 January 2008, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi:
  o --buildrequires deprecate --src, --src is kept for compatibility but its
    behaviour is changed a little (it doesn't download src.rpm anymore)
  o --install-src as user now works for remote medium
  o --install-src will remove succesfully installed src.rpm from
    /var/cache/urpmi/rpms/* (unless post-clean is 0)
- urpmf:
  o add special code for --files simple case, it makes urpmf 3x faster for
    this often used case
  o display a warning when searching "xxx(yyy)" since it is handled as a
    regexp and so the parentheses are useless. suggest using --literal
- urpmq:

    o see "xml-info" option in urpmi.cfg(5) to see when those files are downloaded
    o new require: perl module XML::LibXML
- urpmq:
  o use rpm file instead of hdlist/xml-info when file is local
  o use URPM::Package->changelogs (need perl-URPM 3.06)
- urpmf
  o fix an *old* bug (since december 2002) making urpmf keeps parsed
    hdlist files in memory (was fixed for multitags, but not for simple tags)
- all tools:
  o replace /var/lib/urpmi/MD5SUM with /var/lib/urpmi/MD5SUM.<medium_name>
    (this will allow checking xml media_info is up-to-date even if we don't
    update it at the same time as synthesis is updated)
- urpmi.update, urpmi.addmedia, urpmi.removemedia:
  o drop hdlist support replaced with xml media_info
    (this imply file-deps are correctly handled, see genhdlist2(1))
  o drop option "-c" which used to clean /var/cache/urpmi/headers

  o do remove __db* on priority-upgrade
    (fix regression introduced in 4.10.15)
  o always prompt before doing a priority-upgrade transaction, even if there

- urpmi:
  o fix handling "post-clean: 0" in urpmi.cfg 
    (#36082, regression introduced in 4.10.16)

- drop translated man pages (they are too old)
- urpmi.addmedia:
  o exit code 1 when a medium can't be added
  o enhance parsing of urls with login:password for logins with "@"
    so that password doesn't end up in urpmi.cfg

    install "valid"

Version 4.10.16 - 28 November 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi:
  o small transactions should have at least 8 packages

    (ie --split-level is now 1 by default)
- urpmq:
  o new option --requires-recursive (alias of option -d)
  o bugfix previous release: "urpmq --fuzzy foo" should display all "*foo*" matches

Version 4.10.15 - 26 November 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- all tools:
  o exit with code 1 after displaying usage (instead of exit code 0)
- urpmi:
  o with rsync, use --copy-links (to have the same behaviour as http/ftp, and
    so allow symlinks on the server)
  o fix "urpmi --install-src" (regression introduced in 4.10.9) (#35164)
  o fix --limit-rate (regression introduced in 4.9.12)
  o --auto-update is quite unsafe, but at least now it should be cleaner
    (ensure $urpm doesn't have media twice) (#36134)

Version 4.10.14 - 4 October 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

    pubkey_main_updates is missing)

Version 4.9.23 - 3 May 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi
  o always upgrade (-U) packages instead of installing (-i) them,

    (#28367)
- urpmq
  o rename option -R into --whatrequires
  o rename option -RR into --whatrequires-recursive,

    better (#27176)

  o handle no "synthesis" together with "with_hdlist: synthesis.hdlist.cz"
- urpmi.cfg:
  o new per-medium field "media_info_dir:" which replaces "with_hdlist:" in
    most cases. It allows using either hdlist & synthesis when nor
    "hdlist:" nor "synthesis" is set (#16232)
- urpmi.update:
  o not so verbose by default, only display 
    'medium "foo" is up-to-date' or 'medium "foo" updated'

- urpmi.addmedia:

Version 4.9.2 - 24 November 2006, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- /foo/@86875:bar.src.rpm is not a url with protocol /foo/@86875
- /foo/chroot_tmp/... is not a url with protocol /foo/chroot

Version 4.9.1 - 23 November 2006, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- cleanup locks handling, log locking, and don't say "urpmi database locked"
  when it's the rpm database that is locked
- urpmi:
  o add --nokeep (which overrides urpmi.cfg global option "keep")

Version 4.9.0 - 22 November 2006, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi:
  o don't fork on multiple transactions
  o fix buggy print "::logger_id::" (#27026)

- urpmi.update:
  o don't write urpmi.cfg unless really needed
  o don't write md5sum in urpmi.cfg (bugfix)
- urpmi.addmedia:
  o drop support for "list" file
    (now you must have a hdlist/synthesis on remote server)
  o drop support for searching recursively rpms when there is no
    hdlist/synthesis. Only search in given directory (ie $url/*.rpm)
  o do not use list.<media_name> to store passwords, use /etc/urpmi/netrc
    instead. Also do have the url in urpmi.cfg, only the password is removed
  o change the format of list.<media_name>, it contains only rpm files
    relative to the medium url
  o deprecate "... with <relative hdlist/synthesis>". It is not useful anymore
    (nb: if you want to force using hdlist or synthesis, use --probe-hdlist or
    --probe-synthesis)
  o don't write urpmi.cfg twice
  o do not look for hdlist/synthesis in ../media_info/hdlist$suffix.cz (nb:
    with media.cfg, it will still use hdlist from media/media_info/, but it
    will simply use the hdlist$suffix.cz given by media.cfg )
  o --norebuild is by default (and deprecated): when the local
    hdlist/synthesis is buggy, do not discard it and go searching for *.rpm.
    Make it an error instead
  o fix building synthesis when using *.rpm (ie no hdlist/synthesis)
- urpmi.removemedia: much faster (since it doesn't parse hdlist/synthesis anymore)
- handle "empty" hdlist/synthesis
- generate names.<media_name> only when the medium is created/updated
- major splitting of urpm.pm in many modules
- major splitting of functions in smaller functions
  (eg: update_media was 988 lines long, has been splitted in functions shorter
  than 105 lines)
- big code cleanup/rework
- perl_checker compliance (very useful for such big code rework)
