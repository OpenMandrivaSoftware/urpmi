- gurpmi
  o add support for --clean
- urpmi.update, urpmi.addmedia, urpmi.removemedia:
  o do not check wether the media are valid, 
    it allows "mv /etc/urpmi/urpmi.cfg.{backup,} ; urpmi.update -a" to work
    (nb: not equivalent with urpmi.addmedia, since pubkey will not be imported)
- aria2:
  o do not use --max-file-not-found=3 when downloading rpms

    restarting after priority upgrade
  o fix using --rpm-root & --urpmi-root
  o just do not ask for confirmation before removing packages in
     --auto mode,

Version 6.14 - 23 September 2008

- use "versioned" media_info files
  (needed for aria2 to handle mirrors not having some media_info/*)
- urpmi.addmedia, urpmi.update:
  o for remote media, instead of first checking reconfig.urpmi, try MD5SUM. 
    If it fails try reconfig.urpmi
  o only look for "descriptions" in media_info/
  o do not get "descriptions" on non update media since it's useless and
    potentially slow
- urpmi.addmedia:
  o --distrib: do not skip "debug_for=" media
    (debug media will be added with flag "ignore" if noauto=1)
  o for remote media, do not probe for media_info files in "./", do it only in
    "media_info/"

    suggest to use "-a" to use all matches (#38956)
- urpmi
  o do not write useless "foo (obsoletes foo-xxx)" in

- urpmi.addmedia
  o instead of discarding --update when using --distrib, give it a meaning:
    only add media flagged "update"

  o check usage of -a, -! and the like instead of displaying the ugly
    "Internal error: syntax error ..."
  o in some cases (iso on disk), the hdlist is not available in
    media/xxx/media_info/, but we can use the statedir copy. So use it

  o fix mirrorlist handling
  o fix fallback on hdlist when xml-info not found

    download dir to cachedir)
  o handle variables $ARCH/$RELEASE in mirrorlist
- urpmi:
  o display "%s of packages will be retrieved."
    (need perl-URPM 3.10 and synthesis built with @filesize@)

    o "urpmq -l" is faster (3x)
    o "urpmf -l" is slower (1.5x)
    o "urpmf --sourcerpm" is much faster
    o see "xml-info" option in urpmi.cfg(5) to see when those files are downloaded
    o new require: perl module XML::LibXML
- urpmq:
  o use rpm file instead of hdlist/xml-info when file is local
  o use URPM::Package->changelogs (need perl-URPM 3.06)
- urpmf
  o fix an *old* bug (since december 2002) making urpmf keeps parsed
    hdlist files in memory (was fixed for multitags, but not for simple tags)
- all tools:
  o replace /var/lib/urpmi/MD5SUM with /var/lib/urpmi/MD5SUM.<medium_name>
    (this will allow checking xml media_info is up-to-date even if we don't
    update it at the same time as synthesis is updated)
- urpmi.update, urpmi.addmedia, urpmi.removemedia:
  o drop hdlist support replaced with xml media_info
    (this imply file-deps are correctly handled, see genhdlist2(1))
  o drop option "-c" which used to clean /var/cache/urpmi/headers

- urpmi.addmedia
  o do check md5sum of downloaded synthesis

  o do remove __db* on priority-upgrade
    (fix regression introduced in 4.10.15)
  o always prompt before doing a priority-upgrade transaction, even if there
    is only one priority upgrade package (since there will be more packages to
    install after restarting urpmi)

Version 4.10.19 - 12 December 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi:
  o fix handling "post-clean: 0" in urpmi.cfg 
    (#36082, regression introduced in 4.10.16)

- drop translated man pages (they are too old)
- urpmi.addmedia:
  o exit code 1 when a medium can't be added
  o enhance parsing of urls with login:password for logins with "@"
    so that password doesn't end up in urpmi.cfg
  o adapt to perl-URPM 3.00 API to parse pubkey files
    (nb: $urpm->{keys} is not used anymore)

  o bugfix previous release: "urpmq --fuzzy foo" should display all "*foo*" matches

Version 4.10.15 - 26 November 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- all tools:
  o exit with code 1 after displaying usage (instead of exit code 0)
- urpmi:
  o with rsync, use --copy-links (to have the same behaviour as http/ftp, and
    so allow symlinks on the server)
  o fix "urpmi --install-src" (regression introduced in 4.10.9) (#35164)
  o fix --limit-rate (regression introduced in 4.9.12)
  o --auto-update is quite unsafe, but at least now it should be cleaner
    (ensure $urpm doesn't have media twice) (#36134)

Version 4.10.14 - 4 October 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

    pubkey_main_updates is missing)

Version 4.9.23 - 3 May 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi
  o always upgrade (-U) packages instead of installing (-i) them,

- urpmi
  o fix encoding issue with "--bug ..." introduced in previous version (#28387)

  o drop support for searching recursively rpms when there is no
    hdlist/synthesis. Only search in given directory (ie $url/*.rpm)
  o do not use list.<media_name> to store passwords, use /etc/urpmi/netrc
    instead. Also do have the url in urpmi.cfg, only the password is removed
  o change the format of list.<media_name>, it contains only rpm files
    relative to the medium url
  o deprecate "... with <relative hdlist/synthesis>". It is not useful anymore
    (nb: if you want to force using hdlist or synthesis, use --probe-hdlist or
    --probe-synthesis)
  o don't write urpmi.cfg twice
  o do not look for hdlist/synthesis in ../media_info/hdlist$suffix.cz (nb:
    with media.cfg, it will still use hdlist from media/media_info/, but it
    will simply use the hdlist$suffix.cz given by media.cfg )
  o --norebuild is by default (and deprecated): when the local
    hdlist/synthesis is buggy, do not discard it and go searching for *.rpm.
    Make it an error instead
  o fix building synthesis when using *.rpm (ie no hdlist/synthesis)
- urpmi.removemedia: much faster (since it doesn't parse hdlist/synthesis anymore)
- handle "empty" hdlist/synthesis
- generate names.<media_name> only when the medium is created/updated
- major splitting of urpm.pm in many modules
- major splitting of functions in smaller functions
  (eg: update_media was 988 lines long, has been splitted in functions shorter
  than 105 lines)
- big code cleanup/rework
- perl_checker compliance (very useful for such big code rework)
