.SH NAME
urpme \- rpm wrapper making deinstalls easier for the user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B urpme [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIpackage_names\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
urpme allow packages to be deinstalled including all their dependencies.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\--help\fP"
Print an help message and exit (this is the same as \fB-h\fP or \fB-?\fP).
.IP "\fB\--auto\fP"
Remove package automatically.
.IP "\fB\--test\fP"
Test (same as \fBrpm --test\fP) deinstallation of packages but do not modify the
system.
.IP "\fB\--parallel\fP \fIalias\fP"
Activate distributed execution of urpmi to other machines (it is mandatory that
urpmi is installed but it is not necessary to have media defined on any
machines). \fIalias\fP defines which extension module to use by urpmi (currently
\fBurpmi-parallel-ka-run\fP or \fBurpmi-parallel-ssh\fP) and which machines
should be updated, this alias is defined in the file /etc/urpmi/parallel.cfg as
described below.
.IP "\fB\-v\fP"
Proposes a verbose mode with various messages.
.IP "\fB\-a\fP"
If multiple packages match the substring given, take them all
.SH FILES
.de FN
\fI\|\\$1\|\fP
..
.TP
.FN /usr/sbin/urpmi
The \fBurpmi\fP executable (perl script)
.TP
.FN /var/lib/urpmi/list.*
Contains the list of all packages known by urpmi and their location only
if a password is used to access distant location (using network protocol) or
various directory are used to store packages.
.TP
.FN /var/lib/urpmi/hdlist.*
Contains information about all known packages, it's a summary of rpm headers.
If an hdlist file is used for a medium \fBurpmf\fP can operate completely which
is almost always the case (please refer to \fBurpmf\fP man page for more
informations on this topic).
.TP
.FN /var/lib/urpmi/synthesis.hdlist.*
Contains synthesis information about all known packages built from hdlist files
that can be used by minimal closure algorithm. If these files are not present
hdlist files will be used instead but this is much slower.
.TP
.FN /etc/urpmi/urpmi.cfg
Contains media description, previous format from older urpmi is still accepted.
.TP
.FN /etc/urpmi/parallel.cfg
Contains parallel alias description, format is
\fB<alias>:<interface[(media)]>:<interface_parameter>\fP where \fB<alias>\fP is
a symbolic name, \fB<interface>\fP can be \fBka-run\fP or \fBssh\fP,
\fB<media>\fP is a media list (as \fB--media\fP parameter),
\fB<interface_parameter>\fP is a specific interface parameter list like "-c ssh
-m node1 -m node2" for \fBka-run\fP extension or "node1:node2" for \fBssh\fP
extension.
.TP
.FN /etc/urpmi/skip.list
Contains package expressions that should not be automatically updated. The
format is a list of provide of package (or regular expression if bounded by
slashes \fB/\fP) with optional operator and version string, or regular
expression to match the fullname of packages too.
.TP
.FN /etc/urpmi/inst.list
Contains package names that should be installed instead of updated.
