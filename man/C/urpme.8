.IX urpme
.SH NAME
urpme \- rpm wrapper making deinstalls easier for the user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B urpme [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIpackage_names\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
urpme allow packages to be deinstalled, including all their dependencies.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\--help\fP"
Print a help message and exit (this is the same as \fB-h\fP or \fB-?\fP).
.IP "\fB\--auto\fP"
Remove packages automatically.
.IP "\fB\--test\fP"
Test (same as \fBrpm --test\fP) deinstallation of packages but do not modify the
system.
.IP "\fB\--parallel\fP \fIalias\fP"
Activate distributed execution of urpmi to other machines (it is mandatory that
urpmi is installed, but it is not necessary to have media defined on any
machines). \fIalias\fP defines which extension module is to be used by urpmi
(currently, \fBurpmi-parallel-ka-run\fP or \fBurpmi-parallel-ssh\fP are
available) and which machines should be updated. This alias is defined in the
file /etc/urpmi/parallel.cfg as described below.
.IP "\fB\--root\fP \fIdirectory\fP"
Use the file system tree rooted for rpm install. All operations and scripts
will run after chroot(2). The rpm database that lies in the rooted tree will
be used, but the urpmi configuration comes from the normal system.
.IP "\fB\-v\fP"
Proposes a verbose mode with various messages.
.IP "\fB\-a\fP"
If multiple packages match the given substring, deinstall them all.
.SH FILES
.de FN
\fI\|\\$1\|\fP
..
.TP
.FN /usr/sbin/urpmi
The \fBurpmi\fP executable (perl script)
.TP
.FN /var/lib/urpmi/list.*
Contains the list of all packages known by urpmi and their location. This file
is only used when a password is used to access a distant location (using a
network protocol) or when various directories are used to store the packages.
.TP
.FN /var/lib/urpmi/hdlist.*
Contains information about all known packages; it's a summary of rpm headers.
If an hdlist file is used for a medium, \fBurpmf\fP can operate completely
without accessing this medium (this is almost always the case).
.TP
.FN /var/lib/urpmi/synthesis.hdlist.*
Contains synthesis information about all known packages built from hdlist files
that can be used by minimal closure algorithm. If these files are not present
hdlist files will be used instead but this is much slower.
.TP
.FN /etc/urpmi/urpmi.cfg
Contains media description, previous format from older urpmi is still accepted.
.TP
.FN /etc/urpmi/parallel.cfg
Contains parallel alias description, format is
\fB<alias>:<interface[(media)]>:<interface_parameter>\fP where \fB<alias>\fP is
a symbolic name, \fB<interface>\fP can be \fBka-run\fP or \fBssh\fP,
\fB<media>\fP is a media list (as \fB--media\fP parameter),
\fB<interface_parameter>\fP is a specific interface parameter list like "-c ssh
-m node1 -m node2" for \fBka-run\fP extension or "node1:node2" for \fBssh\fP
extension.
.TP
.FN /etc/urpmi/skip.list
The list of packages that should not be automatically updated when using
--auto-select. It contains one package expression per line; either a package
name followed by an optional operator and version string, or a regular
expression (if bounded by slashes \fB/\fP) to match the fullname of packages
against.
.TP
.FN /etc/urpmi/inst.list
The list of packages that should be installed instead of updated. It has
the same format as the skip.list.
.SH EXIT CODES
.IP 1
Command line inconsistency.
.IP 2
Removing of packages failed.
