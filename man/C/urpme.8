.IX urpme
.SH NAME
urpme \- rpm wrapper making deinstalls easier for the user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B urpme [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIpackage_names\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
urpme allow packages to be deinstalled, including all their dependencies.
\fIpackage_names\fP must have one of the forms \fIname\fP, \fIname-version\fP,
\fIname-version-release\fP, or \fIname-version-release.architecture\fP. If
you want to specify packages more broadly, use the \fB-a\fP option.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\--help\fP"
Prints a help message and exit (this is the same as \fB-h\fP or \fB-?\fP).
.IP "\fB\-a\fP"
If multiple packages match the given substring, deinstall them all.
.IP "\fB\-v\fP"
Proposes a verbose mode with various messages.
.IP "\fB\--auto\fP"
Removes packages non-interactively, without asking questions.
.IP "\fB\--test\fP"
Test deinstallation of packages but do not modify the system.
.IP "\fB\--force\fP"
Force invocation even if some packages do not exist.
.IP "\fB\--parallel\fP \fIalias\fP"
Activate distributed execution of urpmi to other machines (it is mandatory that
urpmi is installed, but it is not necessary to have media defined on any
machines). \fIalias\fP defines which extension module is to be used by urpmi
(currently, \fBurpmi-parallel-ka-run\fP or \fBurpmi-parallel-ssh\fP are
available) and which machines should be updated. This alias is defined in the
file /etc/urpmi/parallel.cfg as described below.
.IP "\fB\--root\fP \fIdirectory\fP"
Use the file system tree rooted for rpm install. All operations and scripts
will run after chroot(2). The rpm database that lies in the rooted tree will
be used, but the urpmi configuration comes from the normal system.
.SH FILES
See \fIurpmi.files\fP(5).
.SH EXIT CODES
.IP 1
Command line inconsistency.
.IP 2
Removing of packages failed.
