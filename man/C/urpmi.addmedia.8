.IX urpmi.addmedia
.SH NAME
urpmi.addmedia \- adds a new rpm media to be used by urpmi
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B urpmi.addmedia [\fIoptions\fP] <\fIname\fP> <\fIurl\fP>
.SH DESCRIPTION
urpmi.addmedia tells urpmi that it can find new rpms at the specified location.
Currently supported media types are: local drives, removable drives (such as
CDs), and networked media via different protocols (http, ftp, ssh and rsync).
.PP
One of the following modes must be chosen:
.PP
http:
.IP "\fB urpmi.addmedia [\fIoptions\fP] <\fIname\fP> http://<\fIlogin\fP>:<\fIpass\fP>@<\fIhost\fP>/<\fIpath\fP> [with <\fIrelative path of synthesis|hdlist\fP>]\fP"
Where <\fIname\fP> is your reference for the media (e.g. "updates").
<\fIname\fP> is optional if \fB--distrib\fP is given in \fIoptions\fP.
.br
<\fIhost\fP>/<\fIpath\fP> is the location of the rpm directory on the net.
.br
<\fIrelative path of hdlist\fP> is the pathname where to find the hdlist of
the rpms. The location is given relative to <\fIpath\fP>.
.br
\fBcurl\fP is used by default to download files, \fBwget\fP may be used if
\fBcurl\fP is not installed or \fB--curl\fP is given in \fIoptions\fP.
.br
\fIeg\fP: urpmi.addmedia http http://jpackage.sf.net/rpm/free with hdlist.cz
.PP
ftp:
.IP "\fB urpmi.addmedia [\fIoptions\fP] <\fIname\fP> ftp://<\fIlogin\fP>:<\fIpass\fP>@<\fIhost\fP>/<\fIpath\fP> [with <\fIrelative path of synthesis|hdlist\fP>]\fP"
The same as for http, just add your login and user if required (Note that
you needn't to specify anonymous as login for anonymous access ftp servers).
.br
Note that if \fBwget\fP is used to download files with a firewall you may
have to add \fBpassive_ftp=on\fP option to \fB/etc/wgetrc\fP. 
.br
\fIeg\fP: urpmi.addmedia ftp ftp://a:a@leia//export/media/main with media_info/hdlist.cz
.PP
ssh:
.IP "\fB urpmi.addmedia [\fIoptions\fP] <\fIname\fP> ssh://<\fIlogin\fP>@<\fIhost\fP>/<\fIpath\fP> [with <\fIrelative path of synthesis|hdlist\fP>]\fP"
The same as for http, just add your login and password if required. It is
strongly recommended to export root key in order not to have to type password
all the time. \fBscp\fP and \fBrsync\fP will be used to get files.
.br
\fIeg\fP: urpmi.addmedia -h ssh ssh://fpons@bi/c/i586/media/main
.PP
rsync:
.IP "\fB urpmi.addmedia [\fIoptions\fP] <\fIname\fP> rsync://<\fIlogin\fP>@<\fIhost\fP>:<\fIport\fP>/<\fIpath\fP> [with <\fIrelative path of synthesis|hdlist\fP>]\fP"
The same as for http, you can use <\fIhost\fP>::<\fIpath\fP> too.
.br
\fIeg\fP: urpmi.addmedia rsync rsync://ftp.orst.edu::mandrake-devel/contrib/ppc with ../../cooker/ppc/media/media_info/hdlist2.cz
.PP
Local drive or NFS:
.br
.IP "\fB urpmi.addmedia [\fIoptions\fP] <\fIname\fP> file://<\fIpath\fP>\fP [with <\fIrelative path of synthesis|hdlist\fP>]\fP"
Where <\fIname\fP> is your reference for the media (e.g. Myrpms).
.br
<\fIpath\fP> is the location of the rpm directory on your machine.
.PP
Removable device:
.br
.IP "\fB urpmi.addmedia [\fIoptions\fP] <\fIname\fP> removable://<\fIpath\fP>\fP [with <\fIrelative path of synthesis|hdlist\fP>]\fP"
<\fIpath\fP> is the location of the rpm directory on your machine when the
removable device is mounted.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\--wget\fP"
Use wget only for downloading distant files. By default curl is used if
available, or wget instead.
.IP "\fB\--curl\fP"
Use curl only for downloading distant files. By default curl is used if
available, or wget instead.
.IP "\fB\--limit-rate \fIrate\fP"
Try to limit the download speed, \fIrate\fP is given in bytes/sec. This option is
not active by default.
.IP "\fB\--proxy\fP \fIproxyhost[:port|1080]\fP"
Use specified HTTP proxy.
.IP "\fB\--proxy-user\fP \fIuser:password\fP"
Use specified user and password to use for proxy authentication.
.IP "\fB\--update\fP"
Add a medium which will be taken into account by \fBMandrakeupdate\fP or
by \fBurpmi --update\fP when looking for updates.
.IP "\fB\--probe-synthesis\fP"
Try to find and use synthesis file if \fBwith ...\fP is not given.
.IP "\fB\--probe-hdlist\fP"
Try to find and use hdlist file if \fBwith ...\fP is not given.
.IP "\fB\--no-probe\fP"
Do not try to find any synthesis or hdlist file.
.IP "\fB\--distrib\fP"
Retrieve a set of media from a distribution. Typically, the URL provided to
\fBurpmi.addmedia\fP will represent the parent directory of a directory
\fBmedia\fP, which in turn will contain various subdirectories for each media
of the distribution. <\fIname\fP> is combined with medium names found to create
newer medium names in the urpmi database. The \fBwith ...\fP option, if
provided, is ignored, as hdlists found on the installation medium are used
instead automatically.
.IP "\fB\--distrib-XXX\fP"
Automatically create a medium for part "XXX" of a distribution. "XXX" may be
typically "main", "contrib", "main_updates" or anything else that has been
configured in that distribution.
.IP "\fB\--from\fP \fIurl\fP"
Use specified URL for list of mirrors. The default from Mandrakesoft is
\fIhttp://www.linux-mandrake.com/mirrorsfull.list\fP.
.IP "\fB\--version\fP \fIversion\fP"
Use specified version when using \fB--distrib-XXX\fP, the default is to use the
version of the package \fBmandrakelinux-release\fP currently installed.
.IP "\fB\--arch\fP \fIarch\fP"
Use specified architecture when using \fB--distrib-XXX\fP, the default is to
use the architecture of the package \fBmandrakelinux-release\fP currently
installed.
.IP "\fB\--virtual\fP"
Create a virtual medium, this only works for file:// and removable:// protocol
and no files will be created in /var/lib/urpmi. The medium is always up-to-date
and so it does not need to be updated by \fBurpmi.update\fP.
.IP "\fB\-c\fP"
Clean headers cache directory in /var/cache/urpmi/headers.
.IP "\fB\-h\fP"
Try to find and use synthesis or hdlist file.
.IP "\fB\-f\fP"
Force rebuild of base files, or of hdlist files when specified twice.
