.SH NAME
urpmf \- RPMFind - Finds the RPM package providing the specified file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B urpmf [\fIoptions\fP] <\fIpattern\fP>
.SH DESCRIPTION
urpmf outputs a list of packages providing the file specified as an argument.
.PP
\fIpattern\fP is the name or part of the name of the file you wish to know which
packages are providing it. \fBurpmf\fP will then print a list of matching files
with their corresponding packages.

Using options you may search though other packages parameters.
\fBurpmf\fP searches through installed and uninstalled packages.
.SH OPTIONS

dependencies only in media marked as update.
.IP "\fB\--media\fP \fImedium1,...,mediumN\fP"
Select specific media to use instead of all media available (or update media is
\fB--update\fP is used).
.IP "\fB\--synthesis\fP \fIfile\fP"
Use the given synthesis\fIfile\fP instead of urpmi db for searching packages and
resolving dependencies.
.IP "\fB\--verbose\fP"
Proposes a verbose mode with various messages.
.IP "\fB\--quiet\fP"
Do not print tag name (default if no tag given on command line, incompatible
with interactive mode).
.IP "\fB\--all\fP"

.SH FILES
.de FN
\fI\|\\$1\|\fP
..
.TP
.FN /usr/bin/urpmf
The \fBurpmf\fP executable (perl script).
.TP
.FN /var/lib/urpmi/list.*
Contains the list of all packages known by urpmi and their location only
if a password is used to access distant location (using network protocol) or
various directory are used to store packages.
.TP
.FN /var/lib/urpmi/hdlist.*
Contains information about all known packages, it's a summary of rpm headers.
If an hdlist file is used for a medium \fBurpmf\fP can operate completely which
is almost always the case (please refer to \fBurpmf\fP man page for more
informations on this topic).
.TP
.FN /var/lib/urpmi/synthesis.hdlist.*
Contains synthesis information about all known packages built from hdlist files
that can be used by minimal closure algorithm. If these files are not present
hdlist files will be used instead but this is much slower.
.TP
.FN /etc/urpmi/urpmi.cfg
Contains media description, previous format from older urpmi is still accepted.
.TP
.FN /etc/urpmi/parallel.cfg
Contains parallel alias description, format is
\fB<alias>:<interface[(media)]>:<interface_parameter>\fP where \fB<alias>\fP is
a symbolic name, \fB<interface>\fP can be \fBka-run\fP or \fBssh\fP,
\fB<media>\fP is a media list (as \fB--media\fP parameter),
\fB<interface_parameter>\fP is a specific interface parameter list like "-c ssh
-m node1 -m node2" for \fBka-run\fP extension or "node1:node2" for \fBssh\fP
extension.
.TP
.FN /etc/urpmi/skip.list
Contains package expressions that should not be automatically updated. The
format is a list of provide of package (or regular expression if bounded by
slashes \fB/\fP) with optional operator and version string, or regular
expression to match the fullname of packages too.
.TP
.FN /etc/urpmi/inst.list
Contains package names that should be installed instead of updated.
